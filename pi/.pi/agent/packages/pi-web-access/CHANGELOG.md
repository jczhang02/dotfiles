# Pi Web Access - Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.7] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- Added `summaryModel` config for choosing the default curator summary draft model from `~/.pi/web-search.json`.

### Fixed
- Made Gemini Web browser-cookie access opt-in via `allowBrowserCookies` or `PI_ALLOW_BROWSER_COOKIES=1`, preventing surprise macOS Keychain prompts during provider checks.
- Restored `code_search` after Exa removed the `get_code_context_exa` MCP tool by falling back to `web_search_exa` with code-focused queries.
- Migrated extension tool schemas from `@sinclair/typebox` to Pi's bundled `typebox` 1.x import path.

## [0.10.6] - 2026-04-04

### Changed
- Added `promptSnippet` metadata for `web_search`, `code_search`, `fetch_content`, and `get_search_content` so Pi 0.59+ includes these tools in the default prompt tool section and improves discoverability of research/fetch flows.

## [0.10.5] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- Forward dynamic request `headers` from `ctx.modelRegistry.getApiKeyAndHeaders()` into `complete()` for query rewriting and summary generation, finishing the pi 0.63+ auth migration for providers that require per-request headers.
- Removed legacy `session_switch`/`session_fork` lifecycle listeners and rely on immutable-session `session_start` reinitialization.

## [0.10.4] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Workflow-based curator hard cutover (`workflow`).** Replaced `curate` with `workflow: "none" | "summary-review"`, added summary-review approval flow with `POST /summarize`, made summary text the primary returned output while retaining raw curated evidence in `details`, and switched timeout handling to submit-first with deterministic summary fallback when no approved draft exists.
- **Auto-open curator for all `web_search` runs (single + multi query).** Searches now open the curator window immediately and stream results live for review workflows; the old countdown/auto-condense fallback path was removed.
- **Exa.ai search provider.** Neural/semantic search available alongside Perplexity and Gemini. 1,000 free requests/month. Set `EXA_API_KEY` env var or `exaApiKey` in `~/.pi/web-search.json`, or select explicitly with `provider: "exa"`. Includes built-in content extraction — when `includeContent` is true, full page text comes back with search results instead of requiring a separate background fetch. Monthly usage tracked in `~/.pi/exa-usage.json` with a warning at 80%.
- **Exa MCP fallback.** When no Exa API key is configured, search routes through `mcp.exa.ai` with zero setup. Supports basic search and `includeContent` but not domain/recency filtering (falls through to Gemini for those).
- **`code_search` tool.** Code/documentation search via Exa MCP (`get_code_context_exa`). No API key required. Returns code examples, docs, and API references from GitHub, Stack Overflow, and official documentation.
- **Glimpse native curator window.** On macOS with Glimpse installed, the search curator opens in a native WKWebView window instead of a browser tab. Faster launch, closer integration. Falls back to browser automatically when Glimpse is unavailable.
- **Curator provider UX rewrite.** Replaced the provider dropdown with provider buttons (hidden when unavailable), made provider re-search additive, added provider badges on all cards (including errors), and switched button states to coverage-based logic keyed by logical query slots so duplicate query text is handled correctly.
- **Per-card provider re-search.** Completed result cards now show "Also try" chips for other available providers. Clicking one searches the same query with that provider and adds a new card below, keeping both results for comparison.
- **Query rewrite with magic wand.** The "Add a search" input now has a ✨ button that rewrites the entered query using a fast LLM (haiku/flash) to make it more specific and effective. The improved query replaces the input text for review before searching.
- **Summary model chooser redesign.** Summary review now follows a provider-first flow: provider dropdown first, then provider-scoped model dropdown.
- **Active summary-generation loading state.** Summary review now shows a dedicated animated in-progress panel while `/summarize` is running (panel sweep, pulse + shimmer placeholders, staged copy updates, and active model label) instead of only a static disabled textarea.
- **Model/provider guard retry for summary generation.** If a selected summary model fails with model/provider configuration errors, curator now retries once with Auto model selection before surfacing a terminal error.
- **Feedback input for summary regeneration.** Optional text field in the summary review panel for providing instructions when regenerating a summary. Only the Regenerate button passes feedback to the prompt; auto-generation and the initial Generate button do not. Feedback is cleared on success and persisted on error for retry.
- **`/curator` command.** Toggle or configure the curator workflow at runtime: `/curator on`, `/curator off`, `/curator summary-review`, or `/curator` to toggle. Persists to `~/.pi/web-search.json` and takes effect on the next `web_search` call.
- **Config-based workflow default.** Added `workflow` field to `~/.pi/web-search.json` for persistent curator preference. Per-call `workflow` parameter on `web_search` takes priority, then config, then the built-in default (`summary-review` with UI, `none` without).
- **"Send selected results without summary" button.** New secondary button in the curator that submits curated results directly without generating or approving a summary. Works from any stage when results are selected. Output uses the raw curated results format with per-query detail.
- **Summary preview modal.** Preview button in the summary actions opens a full-page modal with the summary rendered as formatted markdown. Includes Approve and Regenerate actions with an inline model selector for switching models without leaving the preview.
- **"Also try" provider chips on searching cards.** Provider re-search chips now appear on cards still in-flight, not just completed ones, so alternative-provider searches can be kicked off in parallel without waiting.
- **Live search progress in heading.** Hero heading shows "2 of 4 Searches Complete" while searches are running, with status line showing "2 completed, 2 searching". Reverts to "N Searches Complete" when all finish.
- **Summary subtitle with selection count.** Subtitle now shows "Summary of N selected results" and reacts to selection changes ("Selection changed — regenerating summary…").
- **Summary model selector relocated.** Moved the provider/model dropdowns from the hero area into the summary panel header, next to the title, so the model choice is adjacent to the summary it controls.
- **Improved collapsed TUI preview.** Collapsed search result cards now show adaptive content: summary text when available, curated query titles with source counts when results were sent without summary, or a fallback text line otherwise. Line count hint matching pi's built-in pattern: `... (X more lines, Y total, ctrl+o to expand)`.
- **Inline annotation feedback in preview modal.** Select any text in the rendered summary preview to get a popover with a quoted excerpt and a feedback textarea. Regenerate from the popover to send targeted feedback like `Regarding: "<selected text>" — <your note>`. Supports Cmd/Ctrl+Enter to submit and Escape to dismiss.
- **Concurrent add-search and alt-chip searches.** The "Add a search" input and "Also try" provider chips are no longer locked while other searches are in-flight. Multiple searches can run in parallel.
- **Batch provider search shows searching cards immediately.** Clicking a provider button now creates placeholder cards with loading animations upfront instead of waiting for results to arrive.

### Changed
- Exa search now always requests text content from both direct API and MCP paths (3000 chars default, 50000 with `includeContent`) instead of requesting highlights only. Ensures consistent answer quality regardless of whether Exa returns highlight snippets.
- Adapted model registry calls to pi SDK changes: `getApiKey()` → `getApiKeyAndHeaders()` in `index.ts` and `summary-review.ts`, and `getAvailable()` from async to sync.
- Hoisted dynamic `await import()` calls to static top-level imports in `gemini-web.ts`, `video-extract.ts`, and `youtube-extract.ts`.
- Removed legacy `session_switch`/`session_fork` lifecycle listeners and rely on immutable-session `session_start` reinitialization.

### Removed
- **`result-review` workflow.** Hard cutover — only `"none"` and `"summary-review"` remain. Removed from `WebSearchWorkflow` type, `resolveWorkflow()`, tool schema, `/websearch` command, and `/curator` command.

### Fixed
- Summary generation no longer hard-fails on empty model payloads (`content parts: none`): empty-response failures now fall back to deterministic summary output with explicit fallback metadata (`fallbackReason: "summary-model-empty-response"`) instead of surfacing a terminal UI error.
- Deterministic fallback summaries now strip trailing `Source:`/`Sources:` boilerplate from provider answer text before building query previews, preventing noisy source-list dumps from replacing actual summary prose. Fixed regex matching so `Source:` tokens at the start of provider answers are correctly detected and removed.
- Curator now allows provider switching and add-search actions while summary generation is running. User-initiated search mutations supersede the in-flight summary request client-side and return the UI to results mode so searching can continue without waiting for draft completion.
- Curator client now handles non-2xx server responses consistently across `/provider`, `/search`, `/submit`, `/cancel`, and heartbeat requests, and no longer leaves timeout/heartbeat POST promises unhandled.
- Prevented duplicate completion counting when the same result card is updated more than once.
- Fixed background fetch abort detection to avoid crashing on non-`Error` rejection values.
- Fixed YouTube detection for protocol-less links (`youtu.be/...`) by allowing regex fallback after URL-parse failures.
- Fixed README probing in GitHub clone mode to continue scanning alternate README filenames when one candidate is unreadable.
- Removed dead `search-filter.ts` code path and its stale README file-table entry.
- Gemini provider routing now preserves provider failure context in explicit/final Gemini paths instead of silently collapsing errors to `null`.
- Hardened auto-provider fallback diagnostics: when Exa/Perplexity/Gemini are available but fail at runtime, the thrown error now includes all provider-specific failure reasons instead of dropping context.
- Prevented queued SSE event loss in curator reconnect flows by preserving unsent buffered messages when an SSE flush write fails.
- Hardened curator server provider validation (`/provider`, `/search`) so invalid/unavailable provider names are rejected explicitly instead of mutating session state.
- Fixed `file://` local-video path handling to decode URL-escaped paths and treat malformed file URLs as invalid inputs instead of throwing.
- Prevented path-escape reads in GitHub clone rendering by constraining blob/tree paths to remain within the cloned repository root.
- Prevented symlink-escape traversal in clone tree/list rendering (`buildTree` / `buildDirListing`) by skipping entries that resolve outside the repository root.
- Config parse errors from YouTube/video/Gemini fallback paths are now surfaced explicitly to users instead of silently collapsing to generic fallback messages.
- Fixed provider switching during streaming curator searches (`web_search` + `/websearch`) so remaining queued searches use the latest selected provider instead of the initial one.
- Fixed `fetch_content` timestamp behavior to fail explicitly on invalid timestamp formats and non-video/non-YouTube targets instead of silently ignoring `timestamp` and falling through to generic extraction.
- Removed `Promise.withResolvers` from `web_search` curation flow for broader Node compatibility (no ES2024 runtime requirement).
- Hardened PDF metadata handling (`pdf-extract.ts`) with typed metadata guards and safe `maxPages` clamping.
- Normalized configured/default provider values in `index.ts` and `gemini-search.ts` (including case-insensitive values) so invalid provider strings no longer leak into curator state and now safely fall back to `auto` resolution.
- Hardened config string/number normalization (`index.ts`, `gemini-search.ts`, `gemini-web.ts`, `youtube-extract.ts`, `video-extract.ts`): whitespace-only model/profile/provider values now safely fall back to defaults, and invalid/non-positive video `maxSizeMB` no longer disables local video detection accidentally.
- Hardened API key/config handling (`gemini-api.ts`, `perplexity.ts`, `exa.ts`, `github-extract.ts`): whitespace/invalid key values are no longer treated as configured credentials, and invalid GitHub clone config booleans/numbers/paths now safely fall back to defaults instead of causing silent misconfiguration.
- Fixed mid-flight abort behavior in extraction fallbacks (`extract.ts`, `github-extract.ts`): aborted YouTube/local-video/GitHub extraction no longer degrades into misleading fallback guidance and now returns explicit `Aborted` results instead of continuing with fallback network work.
- Fixed abort lifecycle consistency in GitHub clone extraction (`github-extract.ts`): aborted clone attempts now correctly close activity entries as aborted and avoid persisting failed-abort clone cache entries that could force stale API-only fallback on later requests.
- Fixed activity-monitor lifecycle for shared-clone races (`github-extract.ts`): callers that race onto an already-started clone now properly close their own activity entry (success/error/aborted) instead of leaving stale pending entries.
- Fixed oversized-repo activity status accuracy (`github-extract.ts`): API fallback paths now mark activity success only when API fetch succeeds and correctly log an error when API fallback is unavailable instead of reporting false-positive success.
- Fixed clone-failure fallback telemetry (`github-extract.ts`): when clone fails but API fallback succeeds, activity now reports success instead of remaining an error, and aborted clone-failure paths now short-circuit without extra fallback fetches.
- Fixed GitHub URL host matching (`github-extract.ts`) so `https://www.github.com/...` URLs are recognized as clone/API candidates instead of silently falling through to generic HTTP extraction.
- Hardened curator markdown rendering (`curator-page.ts`) against HTML/script injection by escaping provider answer text before markdown rendering, preserving markdown formatting while blocking raw HTML execution in the UI.
- Closed additional curator link-safety gaps (`curator-page.ts`): sanitized markdown-rendered `href`/`src` protocols and source-link URLs to block `javascript:`/non-http schemes, enforced safe link attrs (`noopener noreferrer`), and stripped inline event-handler attributes from rendered markdown DOM.
- Hardened inline script data serialization in curator page generation (`curator-page.ts`) by escaping Unicode line/paragraph separators (`U+2028`, `U+2029`) in `safeInlineJSON`, preventing malformed script blocks or injection edge cases from unescaped JSON payloads.
- Fixed abort telemetry misclassification in media extractors (`youtube-extract.ts`, `video-extract.ts`): canceled extractions now log activity as aborted (`status: 0`) instead of incorrectly reporting `all ... paths failed` errors after abort races.
- Fixed GitHub URL path decoding in clone/API extraction (`github-extract.ts`): percent-encoded path segments (for example `%20`) are now decoded before blob/tree resolution, so URLs that point to files/directories with encoded characters no longer fall through to incorrect "path not found" output.
- Fixed error-signal downgrade in local-video API fallback (`video-extract.ts`): `tryVideoGeminiApi` now rethrows config parse failures (`Failed to parse ~/.pi/web-search.json`) instead of swallowing them as `null`, preserving actionable root-cause errors.
- Fixed provider config type hardening in search routing (`index.ts`): `normalizeProviderInput` now guards non-string config values before trimming so malformed `provider` entries in `~/.pi/web-search.json` no longer crash runtime provider resolution with `value.trim is not a function`.
- Simplified provider typing flow in curator/search orchestration (`index.ts`): narrowed `resolveProvider` and `PendingCurate.defaultProvider` to resolved provider types, normalized incoming provider strings at callback boundaries, and removed redundant `as SearchProvider | undefined` casts while preserving search behavior.
- Improved curator loading experience in `curator-page.ts`: added animated skeleton loading panel in the content area while searches are in-flight, upgraded searching card visuals with shimmer/active-state styling, and wired loading visibility to real search state transitions (including add-search, done, submit/cancel, and timeout paths).
- Updated curator session timeout defaults in `index.ts`: curator now starts at 20 seconds by default (down from 60) and can be configured via `curatorTimeoutSeconds` in `~/.pi/web-search.json` (capped at 600 seconds).
- Hardened `/websearch` startup error handling in `index.ts`: config/provider bootstrap now runs behind explicit error handling so malformed `~/.pi/web-search.json` no longer throws uncaught command errors before the existing server-start try/catch; users now receive a direct UI error with parse context.
- Hardened extension bootstrap config handling in `index.ts`: shortcut initialization now uses guarded config loading, logging parse errors and falling back to default shortcuts instead of crashing extension registration on malformed `~/.pi/web-search.json`.
- Simplified curator-timeout config plumbing in `index.ts` by removing an unused `getCuratorTimeoutSeconds(config)` parameter path and keeping a single config-read code path.
- Simplified curator bootstrap wiring in `index.ts` by extracting shared provider/timeout setup (`ProviderAvailability`, `CuratorBootstrap`, `getProviderAvailability`, `loadCuratorBootstrap`) and removing duplicated availability assembly across `web_search` and `/websearch` flows.
- Hardened SSE event parsing in curator client (`curator-page.ts`): malformed JSON payloads from SSE `data:` lines now surface as user-visible errors instead of crashing the page via uncaught `JSON.parse` exceptions.
- Fixed "Send results" producing a deterministic summary instead of raw curated results. The submit payload now uses a `rawResults` flag to distinguish explicit "Send results" clicks from timeout-via-submit, which correctly falls back to a deterministic summary.
- Exa search results with no highlight snippets now fall back to `item.text` (truncated to 1000 chars) instead of producing empty answers. Empty snippets are also skipped during MCP answer assembly.
- Exa MCP result parsing now handles `Highlights:` response blocks in addition to `Text:` blocks, and strips trailing `---` separators from parsed content.
- Fixed stale heading count after a user-added search fails and its card is removed. `updateSummaryText()` is now called in all card-removal error paths.
- Fixed heading not reflecting new in-progress searches immediately. Adding a search via "Also try" or "Add a search" now updates the heading to show the new total (e.g., "4 of 5 Searches Complete") right away instead of waiting for completion.

## [0.10.3] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- `/google-account` command to report the active Google account currently authenticated for Gemini Web.
- `chromeProfile` config support for targeting a non-default Chromium profile when reading Gemini Web cookies.
- `searchModel` config support for overriding the Gemini API model used by `web_search`.

### Changed
- Chromium cookie extraction now tries Helium, Chrome, and Arc on macOS, plus Chromium and Chrome on Linux, with profile-aware cookie paths and per-platform key handling.
- Gemini Web availability checks now pass required cookie names into cookie extraction and can look up the active signed-in Google account without changing existing `isGeminiWebAvailable()` callers.
- README documentation now covers macOS/Linux cookie extraction limits, the new config fields, the `/google-account` command, and the expanded `chrome-cookies.ts` role.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **Interactive search curation.** Press Ctrl+Shift+S during or after a multi-query search to open a browser-based review UI. Results stream in live via SSE. Pick which queries to keep, add new searches on the fly, switch providers — then submit to send only the curated results to the agent.
- **Auto-condense pipeline.** When the countdown expires without manual curation, a single LLM call (Claude Haiku by default) condenses all search results into a deduplicated briefing organized by topic. Preprocessing enriches the prompt with URL overlap, answer similarity, and source quality analysis. Configure via `"autoFilter"` in `~/.pi/web-search.json`. Full uncondensed results stored and retrievable via `get_search_content`.
- **Configurable keyboard shortcuts.** Both shortcuts (curate: Ctrl+Shift+S, activity monitor: Ctrl+Shift+W) can be remapped via `"shortcuts"` in `~/.pi/web-search.json`. Changes take effect on restart.
- **`/websearch` command** — opens the curator directly from pi without an agent round-trip. Accepts optional comma-separated queries or opens empty.
- **Task-aware condensation.** Optional `context` parameter on `web_search` — a brief description of the user's task. The condenser uses it to focus the briefing on what matters.
- **Provider selection** — global dropdown in the curator UI to switch between Perplexity and Gemini. Persists to `~/.pi/web-search.json`.
- **Live condense status in countdown.** Shows "condensing..." while the LLM is working, then "N searches condensed" once complete.
- Markdown rendering in curator result cards via marked.js.
- Query-level result cards with expandable answers and source lists. Check/uncheck to include or exclude.
- SSE streaming with keepalive, socket health checks, and buffered delivery.
- Idle-based timer (60s default, adjustable). Timeout sends all results as safe default.
- Keyboard shortcuts: Enter (submit), Escape (skip), A (toggle all).
- Dark/light theme via `prefers-color-scheme` with teal accent palette.

### Changed
- **Curate enabled by default.** Multi-query searches show a 10-second review window; single queries send immediately. Pass `curate: false` to opt out.
- **Curate shortcut opens browser immediately, even mid-search.** Remaining results stream in live via SSE.
- **Tool descriptions encourage multi-query research.** The `queries` param explains how to vary phrasing and scope across 2-4 queries, with good/bad examples.
- **Curated results instruct the LLM.** Tool output prefixed with an instruction telling the LLM to use curated results as-is.
- Expanded view shows full answer text per query with source titles and domains.
- Non-curated `web_search` calls now respect the saved provider preference.
- Config helpers generalized from `loadSavedProvider`/`saveProvider` to `loadConfig`/`saveConfig`.

### Fixed
- Curated `onSubmit` passed the original full query list instead of the filtered list, inflating `queryCount`.
- Collapsed curated status mixed source URL counts with query counts.

### New files
- `curator-server.ts` — ephemeral HTTP server with SSE streaming, state machine, heartbeat watchdog, and token auth.
- `curator-page.ts` — HTML/CSS/JS for the curator UI with markdown rendering and overlay transitions.
- `search-filter.ts` — auto-condense pipeline: preprocessing, LLM condensation via pi's model registry, and post-processing (citation verification, source list completion).

## [0.7.3] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- Jina Reader fallback for JS-rendered pages. When Readability returns insufficient content (cookie notices, consent walls, SPA shells), the extraction chain now tries Jina Reader (`r.jina.ai`) before falling back to Gemini. Jina handles JavaScript rendering server-side and returns clean markdown. No API key required.
- JS-render detection heuristic (`isLikelyJSRendered`) produces more specific error messages when pages appear to load content dynamically.
- Actionable guidance when all extraction methods fail, listing steps to configure Gemini API or use `web_search` instead.

### Changed
- HTTP fetch headers now mimic Chrome (realistic `User-Agent`, `Sec-Fetch-*`, `Accept-Language`) instead of the default Node.js user agent. Reduces blocks from bot-detection systems.
- Short Readability output (< 500 chars) is now treated as a content failure, triggering the fallback chain. Previously, a 266-char cookie notice was returned as "successful" content.
- Extraction fallback order is now: HTTP+Readability → RSC → Jina Reader → Gemini URL Context → Gemini Web → error with guidance.

### Fixed
- `parseTimestamp` now rejects negative values in colon-separated format (`-1:30`, `1:-30`). Previously only the numeric path (`-90`) rejected negatives, while the colon path computed and returned negative seconds.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-02-03

### Added
- `model` parameter on `fetch_content` to override the Gemini model per-request (e.g. `model: "gemini-2.5-flash"`)
- Collapsed TUI results now show a 200-char text preview instead of just the status line
- LICENSE file (MIT)

### Changed
- Default Gemini model updated from `gemini-2.5-flash` to `gemini-3-flash-preview` across all API, search, URL context, YouTube, and video paths. Gemini Web gracefully falls back to `gemini-2.5-flash` when the model header isn't available.
- README rewritten: added tagline, badges, "Why" section, Quick Start, corrected "How It Works" routing order, fixed inaccurate env var precedence claim, added missing `/v/` YouTube format, restored `/search` command docs, collapsible Files table

### Fixed
- `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` env var now takes precedence over config file value, matching `GEMINI_API_KEY` behavior and README documentation (was reversed)
- `package.json` now includes `repository`, `homepage`, `bugs`, and `description` fields (repo link was missing from pi packages site)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-03

### Added
- **Multi-provider web search**: `web_search` now supports Perplexity, Gemini API (with Google Search grounding), and Gemini Web (cookie auth) as search providers. New `provider` parameter (`auto`, `perplexity`, `gemini`) controls selection. In `auto` mode (default): Perplexity → Gemini API → Gemini Web. Backwards-compatible — existing Perplexity users see no change.
- **Gemini API grounded search**: Structured citations via `groundingMetadata` with source URIs and text-to-source mappings. Google proxy URLs are resolved via HEAD redirects. Configured via `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `geminiApiKey` in config.
- **Gemini Web search**: Zero-config web search for users signed into Google in Chrome. Prompt instructs Gemini to cite sources; URLs extracted from markdown response.
- **Gemini extraction fallback**: When `fetch_content` fails (HTTP 403/429, Readability fails, network errors), automatically retries via Gemini URL Context API then Gemini Web extraction. Each has an independent 60s timeout. Handles SPAs, JS-heavy pages, and anti-bot protections.
- **Local video file analysis**: `fetch_content` accepts file paths to video files (MP4, MOV, WebM, AVI, etc.). Detected by path prefix (`/`, `./`, `../`, `file://`), validated by extension and 50MB limit. Two-tier fallback: Gemini API (resumable upload via Files API with proper MIME types, poll-until-active and cleanup) → Gemini Web (free, cookie auth).
- **Video prompt parameter**: `fetch_content` gains optional `prompt` parameter for asking specific questions about video content. Threads through YouTube and local video extraction. Without prompt, uses default extraction (transcript + visual descriptions).
- **Video thumbnails**: YouTube results include the video thumbnail (fetched from `img.youtube.com`). Local video results include a frame extracted via ffmpeg (at ~1 second). Returned as image content parts alongside text — the agent sees the thumbnail as vision context.
- **Configurable frame extraction**: `frames` parameter (1-12) on `fetch_content` for pulling visual frames from YouTube or local video. Works in five modes: frames alone (sample across entire video), single timestamp (one frame), single+frames (N frames at 5s intervals), range (default 6 frames), range+frames (N frames across the range). Endpoint-inclusive distribution with 5-second minimum spacing.
- **Video duration in responses**: Frame extraction results include the video duration for context.
- `searchProvider` config option in `~/.pi/web-search.json` for global provider default
- `video` config section: `enabled`, `preferredModel`, `maxSizeMB`

### Changed
- `PerplexityResponse` renamed to `SearchResponse` (shared interface for all search providers)
- Extracted HTTP pipeline from `extractContent` into `extractViaHttp` for cleaner Gemini fallback orchestration
- `getApiKey()`, `API_BASE`, `DEFAULT_MODEL` exported from `gemini-api.ts` for use by search and URL Context modules
- `isPerplexityAvailable()` added to `perplexity.ts` as non-throwing API key check
- Content-type routing in `extract.ts`: only `text/html` and `application/xhtml+xml` go through Readability; all other text types (`text/markdown`, `application/json`, `text/csv`, etc.) returned directly. Fixes the OpenAI cookbook `.md` URL that returned "Untitled (30 chars)".
- Title extraction for non-HTML content: `extractTextTitle()` pulls from markdown `#`/`##` headings, falls back to URL filename
- Combined `yt-dlp --print duration -g` call fetches stream URL and duration in a single invocation, reused across all frame extraction paths via `streamInfo` passthrough
- Shared helpers in `utils.ts` (`formatSeconds`, error mapping) eliminate circular imports and duplication across youtube-extract.ts and video-extract.ts

### Fixed
- `fetch_content` TUI rendered `undefined/undefined URLs` during progress updates (renderResult didn't handle `isPartial`, now shows a progress bar like `web_search` does)
- RSC extractor produced malformed markdown for `<pre><code>` blocks (backticks inside fenced code blocks) -- extremely common on Next.js documentation pages
- Multi-URL fetch failures rendered in green "success" color even when 0 URLs succeeded (now red)
- `web_search` queries parameter described as "parallel" in schema but execution is sequential (changed to "batch"; `urls` correctly remains "parallel")
- Proper error propagation for frame extraction: missing binaries (yt-dlp, ffmpeg, ffprobe), private/age-restricted/region-blocked videos, expired stream URLs (403), timestamp-exceeds-duration, and timeouts all produce specific user-facing messages instead of silent nulls
- `isTimeoutError` now detects `execFileSync` timeouts via the `killed` flag (SIGTERM from timeout was previously unrecognized)
- Float video durations (e.g. 15913.7s from yt-dlp) no longer produce out-of-range timestamps — durations are floored before computing frame positions
- `parseTimestamp` consistently floors results across both bare-number ("90.5" → 90) and colon ("1:30.5" → 90) paths — previously the colon path returned floats
- YouTube thumbnail assignment no longer sets `null` on the optional `thumbnail` field when fetch fails (was a type mismatch; now only assigned on success)

### New files
- `gemini-search.ts` -- search routing + Gemini Web/API search providers with grounding
- `gemini-url-context.ts` -- URL Context API extraction + Gemini Web extraction fallback
- `video-extract.ts` -- local video file detection, Gemini Web/API analysis with Files API upload
- `utils.ts` -- shared formatting and error helpers for frame extraction

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-02

### Added
- YouTube video understanding in `fetch_content` via three-tier fallback chain:
  - **Gemini Web** (primary): reads Chrome session cookies from macOS Keychain + SQLite, authenticates to gemini.google.com, sends YouTube URL via StreamGenerate endpoint. Full visual + audio understanding with timestamps. Zero config needed if signed into Google in Chrome.
  - **Gemini API** (secondary): direct REST calls with `GEMINI_API_KEY`. YouTube URLs passed as `file_data.file_uri`. Configure via `GEMINI_API_KEY` env var or `geminiApiKey` in `~/.pi/web-search.json`.
  - **Perplexity** (fallback): uses existing `searchWithPerplexity` for a topic summary when neither Gemini path is available. Output labeled as "Summary (via Perplexity)" so the agent knows it's not a full transcript.
- YouTube URL detection for all common formats: `/watch?v=`, `youtu.be/`, `/shorts/`, `/live/`, `/embed/`, `/v/`, `m.youtube.com`
- Configurable via `~/.pi/web-search.json` under `youtube` key (`enabled`, `preferredModel`)
- Actionable error messages when extraction fails (directs user to sign into Chrome or set API key)
- YouTube URLs no longer fall through to HTTP/Readability (which returns garbage); returns error instead

### New files
- `chrome-cookies.ts` -- macOS Chrome cookie extraction using Node builtins (`node:crypto`, `node:sqlite`, `child_process`)
- `gemini-web.ts` -- Gemini Web client ported from surf's gemini-client.cjs (cookie auth, StreamGenerate, model fallback)
- `gemini-api.ts` -- Gemini REST API client (generateContent, file upload/processing/cleanup for Phase 2)
- `youtube-extract.ts` -- YouTube extraction orchestrator with three-tier fallback and activity logging

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-02

### Added
- Bundled `librarian` skill -- structured research workflow for open-source libraries with GitHub permalinks, combining fetch_content (cloning), web_search (recent info), and git operations (blame, log, show)

### Fixed
- Session fork event handler was registered as `session_branch` (non-existent event) instead of `session_fork`, meaning forks never triggered cleanup (abort pending fetches, clear clone cache, restore session data)
- API fallback title for tree URLs with a path (e.g. `/tree/main/src`) now includes the path (`owner/repo - src`), consistent with clone-based results
- Removed unnecessary export on `getDefaultBranch` (only used internally by `fetchViaApi`)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- GitHub repository clone extraction for `fetch_content` -- detects GitHub code URLs, clones repos to `/tmp/pi-github-repos/`, and returns actual file contents plus local path for further exploration with `read` and `bash`
- Lightweight API fallback for oversized repos (>350MB) and commit SHA URLs via `gh api`
- Clone cache with concurrent request deduplication (second request awaits first's clone)
- `forceClone` parameter on `fetch_content` to override the size threshold
- Configurable via `~/.pi/web-search.json` under `githubClone` key (enabled, maxRepoSizeMB, cloneTimeoutSeconds, clonePath)
- Falls back to `git clone` when `gh` CLI is unavailable (public repos only)
- README: GitHub clone documentation with config, flow diagram, and limitations

### Changed
- Refactored `extractContent`/`fetchAllContent` signatures from positional `timeoutMs` to `ExtractOptions` object
- Blob/tree fetch titles now include file path (e.g. `owner/repo - src/index.ts`) for better disambiguation in multi-URL results and TUI

### Fixed
- README: Activity monitor keybinding corrected from `Ctrl+Shift+O` to `Ctrl+Shift+W`

## [0.4.5] - 2026-02-01

### Changed
- Added package keywords for npm discoverability

## [0.4.4] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed
- Adapt execute signatures to pi v0.51.0: reorder signal, onUpdate, ctx parameters across all three tools

## [0.4.3] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed
- Google API compatibility: Use `StringEnum` for `recencyFilter` to avoid unsupported `anyOf`/`const` JSON Schema patterns

## [0.4.2] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed

- Single-URL fetches now store content for retrieval via `get_search_content` (previously only multi-URL)
- Corrected `get_search_content` usage syntax in fetch_content help messages

### Changed

- Increased inline content limit from 10K to 30K chars (larger content truncated but fully retrievable)

### Added

- Banner image for README

## [0.4.1] - 2026-01-26

### Changed
- Added `pi` manifest to package.json for pi v0.50.0 package system compliance
- Added `pi-package` keyword for npm discoverability

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-19

### Added

- PDF extraction via `unpdf` - fetches PDFs from URLs and saves as markdown to `~/Downloads/`
  - Extracts text, metadata (title, author), page count
  - Supports PDFs up to 20MB (vs 5MB for HTML)
  - Handles arxiv URLs with smart title fallback

### Fixed

- Plain text URL detection now uses hostname check instead of substring match

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-19

### Added

- RSC (React Server Components) content extraction for Next.js App Router pages
  - Parses flight data from `<script>self.__next_f.push([...])</script>` tags
  - Reconstructs markdown with headings, tables, code blocks, links
  - Handles chunk references and nested components
  - Falls back to RSC extraction when Readability fails
- Content-type validation rejects binary files (images, PDFs, audio, video, zip)
- 5MB response size limit (checked via Content-Length header) to prevent memory issues

### Fixed

- `fetch_content` now handles plain text URLs (raw.githubusercontent.com, gist.githubusercontent.com, any text/plain response) instead of failing with "Could not extract readable content"

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-11

### Added

- Activity monitor widget (`Ctrl+Shift+O`) showing live request/response activity
  - Displays last 10 API calls and URL fetches with status codes and timing
  - Shows rate limit usage and reset countdown
  - Live updates as requests complete
  - Auto-clears on session switch

### Changed

- Refactored activity tracking into dedicated `activity.ts` module

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-06
